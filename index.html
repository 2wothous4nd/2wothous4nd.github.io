        <h2>The Ghosted</h2>
        <p>

            We met online, on league. <br>
            She played Yuumi. I played Draven.<br>
            She was funny, smart, charming. <br>
            She said she was looking for someone to duo with.<br>
            We clicked right away.<br>

            <br>

            We mesaged every day, for hours. We shared our hopes, our fears, our secrets.<br>
            We made each other laugh, we made each other feel.<br>
            We had so much in common, so much chemistry.<br>

            <br>

            We decided to meet in person, after a week of talking.<br>
            She said she couldn’t wait to see me, to hold me, to kiss me.<br>
            She said she was falling for me, and I felt the same.<br>

            <br>

            We agreed on a date, a time, a place. I was nervous, but excited.<br>
            I picked out my best outfit, bought flowers and RP card.<br>
            I checked my phone for her confirmation, but there was none.<br>

            <br>

            I waited for her call, her text, her message. <br> <br> But there was  <i>nothing</i>. <br><br>
            I tried to reach her, but she didn’t answer.<br>
            I checked her profile, but it was gone.<br>

            <br>

            She ghosted me.<br>
            She disappeared from my life, without a word, without a reason.<br>
            She broke my heart, without a care, without a remorse.<br>

            <br>
            She was never <b>real</b>. <br>
            She was never <b>mine</b>. <br>
            She was never <b>there</b>...</p>
